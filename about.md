My name is Isfandyar and I love Data Science!



### More Information

Every bit of data has a story to tell, and I like to explore those stories.

I fell in love with programming ever since I wrote my first 'Hello World' program in high school. After high school, I quickly realized that data science is the future of computing. I started taking steps in that direction ever since to ensure that I will build tools that could improve people's lives around the world. I am a swift learner and am constantly looking to gain new skills and expand my software development and data science knowledge.

During this pandemic, I decided to challenge myself further to earn a Diploma in Data Science. I have a quantitative and qualitative research background, which gives me a deep understanding of how data works. This helped me develop new skills in data cleaning and transformation, exploratory data analysis, building data models, creating data visualization, and telling a story with data.
